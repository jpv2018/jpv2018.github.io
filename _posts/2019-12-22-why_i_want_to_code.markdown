Ever since I was young I always had a high interest in technology, whether it was video games, computers, or the next new gadget. Beyond the general interest in the function of the technology, I was always interested in how everything functioned. 

When I was in high school I had an extra slot in my schedule for an elective and I took a Web Mastering class. The simple HTML code in this class came much more naturally to me than it did most students in the class, and I found joy in the process as well as seeing a finished product that I created. 

I have enjoyed my time in music and as a band teacher, but I feel that it is a good idea to have more options available to me. Software development is a good fit because I can do small jobs on weekends and during breaks from school, or I can choose to take on a full-time development job at the end of a school year if I want to take my career that direction.

I look forward to where this all goes, and I am excited to experience this learning process!
