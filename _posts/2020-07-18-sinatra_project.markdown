I really enjoyed the Sinatra project. Activerecord and Sinatra really started to make a lot more sense when I got to use them in this context. One issue that I ran into was that my delete button kept throwing an error saying that "Sinatra did not recognize this ditty." After a few hours of research and looking over my code, I finally asked someone to look over it for me. I felt pretty stupid for a minute, because all that I was lacking was a '>' at the end of the <form> code to create the delete button. It's not a surprise to me that I overlooked it though, because ERB files can start looking pretty cluttered. Now I just know that I need to be extra particular when I code my ERB files! This project was a lot of fun for me, and I am excited to see what comes next!
